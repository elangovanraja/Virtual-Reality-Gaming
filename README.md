# Virtual-Reality-Gaming

The idea of Virtual Reality (VR) has been the most recent Breakthrough in the Gaming sector,
with motion detectors, Virtual Vision, Virtual Audio and Interactive Devices allowing players to
experience a whole new gaming experience. However, the work and perspectives have not
been able to implement the sensation of touch in the virtual reality, which has left a huge gap
in overlapping virtuality with Reality. In this project will throw light on the issue with special
attention to hand-based touch sensation. Specifically we will be mathematically calculating the
force exerted by the virtual object and we will be mapping pre-defined sensations with the
associated parts to induce the sensation of touch. In conclusion, this project, by studying the
physics part of the virtual objects, sheds new light on the neglected aspect of touch in Virtual
Reality. 

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
This system was created mainly to reduce the gap between the real world and virtual game.
This suit actually allows the user to feel the environment and interact with it. Binary code is
generated with the collected data about the environment to narrow down the player and the
force exerted on the player in a multiplayer game.
DELIVERABLES:
 Data acquisition
 Triggers
 Views
 Stored procedures
 User privileges
 Database Backup
 Transactions

ASSUMPTION:
 The sensation of touch will enhance user gaming experience
 The sensors being used provides accurate data
 There is no barriers between bullet and player
 The coordinates of the bullet and players are known
 The number players are limited and known
 Game is considered in a 2D plane

LIMITATION:
 Sensation of smell, breeze aren’t implemented
 Increased complexity
 When the environment of the game extends, accurate matching between bullet and
player becomes difficult
